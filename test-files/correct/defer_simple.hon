# Test defer and regular statement ordering
#
# This verifies that:
# 1. Regular statements execute in order
# 2. Deferred statements execute BEFORE return (LIFO order)
# 3. Return value comes from regular flow
#
# Expected exit code: 30

main :: func() i32 {
    a := 10            # regular statement 1
    defer b := 20      # deferred - executes before return
    c := 30            # regular statement 2
    return c           # returns 30
}
