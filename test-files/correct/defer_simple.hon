# Test defer and regular statement ordering
#
# This verifies that:
# 1. Regular statements execute in order
# 2. Deferred statements are collected separately in the AST
# 3. Return value comes from regular flow
#
# NOTE: Currently deferred code is generated AFTER returns, so it won't
# execute. Proper defer semantics require inserting cleanup before returns.
# Expected exit code: 30

main :: func() i32 {
    a := 10            # regular statement 1
    defer b := 20      # deferred - generated but placed after return
    c := 30            # regular statement 2
    return c           # returns 30
}
