# Test calling convention handling
# Verifies that c, cobol, fortran can be used as:
# 1. Calling convention modifiers before 'func'
# 2. Regular variable names

# Use 'c' as a calling convention
extern_func :: c func(x: i32) i32

# Use 'c' as a variable name
main :: func() i32 {
    c := 10            # 'c' as variable name
    fortran := 20      # 'fortran' as variable name
    cobol := 12        # 'cobol' as variable name
    return c + fortran + cobol
}
